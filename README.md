# ProjectEuler
Project Euler solutions in Java.

My own solutions to some of the problems on the popular problem solving website .
http://projecteuler.net

Included in the source is a simple batch script used to compile and run a specific problem, if available.
To use, open compile.bat and enter the problem number, making sure three digits are entered.
For instance, to run the solution to problem #17, type in 017.
